               <p>The paper mockup just gives a base idea of what needs to be included, what needs to be headlined, and the approximate layout. It gives a general idea of the purpose and what is needed from everyone includeded in the process (in this case, specifically, the designer) so that the rest of the project runs smoothly with the updated information.</p>

            <p>The computer mockup was able to include sample work as well as more colours. After thinking about the project more and what the desired effect was, the navigation menu was looked into in more detail. The colours were looked into in more detail so that there were at least approximate starting colours.</p>
            <p>The homepage was generally designed with some JavaScript ideas as well however those were notes for later (including rotating the top three images and blinking the 3X3 grid under the LOGO/NAME/DESIGN). This also helped organize how the secondary pages would work within the navigation menu and what would be featured.</p>

               <h3 style='color:black;font-size:2;'>HTML Draft 1</h3>
               <img style='display:inline-block;float:right;width:50%;margin-left:2%;' src='images/mockup/art/3-01finalHTML.JPG'>

               <p>Version 1 of the actual HTML was very similar to the previous mockup. The navigation menu has still yet to be finalized. The jQuery was used to have the 3X3 Grid blinking however it was decided that the top three images would stay static rather than rotate as well as the blinking of the boxes below.</p>
               <p>Although the images are broken up due to the longer screen, it is still very represnetative of the prior mockup.</p>
               <p>Once the webpage has started being coded, it is more logical to determine how the pages will interact with each other and new ideas were thought of rather than just a typical multi-page website.</p>
